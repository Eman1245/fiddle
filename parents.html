        <h2>I don't know if this is something common or not, but it is extremely rare for me
            to have pictures of my dad and mom together. If anything, I'll have pictures of only my mom
            or only my dad, but hardly any with both in the same frame. I remember me and my brother put a lot
            of effort into posing them and making sure the lighting was nice and on their faces, because we both
            wanted this one to turn out good, which I feel it did. This is one of those pictures that I add to my
            very small but meaningful "Parents" photo album.
