        <h2>A fairly simple picture. I took this when my family and I went to celebrate my moms birthday in Scottsdale.
            Since her birthday is 1 day before new years eve, there were still all the typical Christmas decorations all throughout
            the plaza. I had never been there at that time of the year (or any time for that matter), but nevertheless, the decorations
            and the lighting made the darkness of the night seem less harsh than what it usually is.
