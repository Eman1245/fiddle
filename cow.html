        <h2>Remember in the picture of the goat how I very briefly mentioned that there were
            also small cows in the play pen? Well, this was one of those cows. Same as the goat,
            this cow was following me around and was also very adamant in getting her photo taken.
            I do love the goat picture more than this one, but I cannot deny that theres something
            about animals with big noses that makes me laugh and fills me with so much joy. I remember
            asking the attendant the name of the cow but I don't remember what name they told me. So from now
            on, I name this cow: Mocha. Get it? Because she's brown like mocha is... and she produces milk, which
            is a key component of making a mocha latte... I thought it was smart.
