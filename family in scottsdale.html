        <h2>This was a selfie. I never really like taking pictures like this. It feels unprofessional and awkward. But theres something
            about being around people you love and care about that makes it worth it. Again, this is tied in with the previous picture that
            took setting in Scottsdale. With Christmas decorations all over the place, we saw a giant present filled with lights which you could
            walk into and use as a backdrop, which is exactly what we did. I had to take the picture since I was the one at the edge and have the longest
            arms. I didn't mind, but I did feel awkward. But even then, I love this picture since I don't keep that many pictures of all of us as a family.
