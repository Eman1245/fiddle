    <h2>This is another one of my favorites. The reason I like this one is because 1: I took it at night and was able to
        play with the exposure and night mode settings on my phone, and 2: it's the Japanese Friendship Garden. This specific
        moment was very special for me. The garden was having a special event which lined up with the nights' beautiful full moon.
        I went with my girlfriend and we just walked, took pictures, and of course took in the view. This image shows the calm and peaceful
        state of mind that you are immersed into when you walk through the garden. I wanted to capture that feeling as best as I could, and
        this was the result.
