        <h2>Meet Bella. This is my brother's house cat. A very charming girl. She loves socializing and
            being around people. In this moment, she happened to stumble upon my paper bag of Taco Bell that
            I had taken and was very intrigued. I was lucky enough to grab her attention as she was looking up
            from said bag, since her head was mostly inside of it seconds before. I love this cat, though I'm not
            sure the same could be said for her towards me. She tolerates me at best, I don't know about love yet.
