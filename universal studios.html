        <h2>The memory of going to Universal Studios Hollywood. I took this photo on my school's graduation trip to
            Universal Studios. This was on the second of the three days we were going to be there. Honestly, this is
            one of the better pictures I took on the whole trip. There's just something about this that makes it feel
            so rich and vibrant. It reminds me of how the world looked like as a child. The pop of colors, the animated
            characters all over the place. The funky text. It reminds me of happy times, which I guess is the whole point
            of Universal Studios.
