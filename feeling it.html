        <h2>I believe I was at a 99 cents store in this one. I went with one of my closer friends, Jesus, in search
            of... something. To be honest, we were probably just bored or something. What I do remember is that I had
            gone to the Arizona State Fair a couple days before this, hence the henna design on my hand. We were just
            walking around the store and we stubbled upon a rack filled with sunglasses. I specifically liked these ones
            and decided to try them on and take a picture. Thats it. It was a really random moment :3
