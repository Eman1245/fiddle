        <h2>This is what we had originally planned to do on the day of the photoshoot. A single image
            of our family being as happy as could be in the windy park. We were mostly caught off-guard here,
            which I'm assuming the photographer did on purpose, but I'm glad we were since it captured pure joy.
            Here is (from left to right): My dad, Me, my mom, my brother, and his husband. Happy. Yes, my dad is happy
            to be there, that is his happy face.
