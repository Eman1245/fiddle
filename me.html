        <h2>My name is Emmanuel G. I am currently a student at Gateway Community College to earn a degree in
        Information Technology with a focus on Desktop Support. I have always been interested in photography
        since my older brother is a photographer and has always tried to involve me in his works whenever I asked.
        As you can see, I'm not much for taking a lot of professional or top tier pictures. I prefer to use my time
        and camera quality to take funny laughable pictures, especially of myself.
