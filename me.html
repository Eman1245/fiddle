        <h1 class="dramatic">Hello! This is a brief overview about me</h1>
        <h2>My name is Emmanuel G. I am currently a student at Gateway Community College to earn a degree in
        Information Technology with a focus on Desktop Support. I have always been interested in photography
        since my older brother is a photographer and has always tried to involve me in his works whenever I asked.
