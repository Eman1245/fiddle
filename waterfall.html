        <h2>This image was taken on a vacation trip to Oaxaca, Mexico with my older cousin.
            This was a rather spontaneous trip in the sense that I was asked if I wanted to go and we went.
            There was obviously planning that went into all of this, but I didn't have the idea or plan to
            go to Mexico in that year, so in that sense it was spontaneous. This specific moment was on my last day
            I was there. We took a bus all the way to this location and stayed there for about 3 hours.
            I was fascinated with the sight and just sat there taking in the view and the air, which seemed to be
            different in the sense that it felt cleaner. This image captures the peace and amazement I felt as I was there.
