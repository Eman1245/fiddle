       <h2>Ok I know that I've shown fairly professional and decent photos up until now,
        but I really love this one. I took this while at the Arizona State Fair's petting zoo. There were mainly sheep and goats,
        along with the occasional small cows and a kangaroo for some reason. But that's not the point. The point here is that this
        goat followed me around the whole play pen and was very adamant in getting his picture taken, so I did. When I tell you
        that this is the highlight of all my photo gallery, I mean it. It's funny, it's cute, it's a goat. I love it. Hehehe.
