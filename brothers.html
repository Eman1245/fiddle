        <h2>A classic sibling photoshoot. This was taken when my brother insisted we had a family photoshoot
            for whatever reason. This was at a park right next to the Phoenix Zoo. At first we had planned to only
            take group photos as a family, but then spontaneity kicked in and we decided to have solo shots and
            group ourselves however we wanted to in that moment. This was one of the many products of that. He decided
            we would all wear formal clothing for the occasion. I wasn't particularly against it, but I was too lazy to wear
            dress shoes, so I wore sneakers (which you can unfortunately not see).
